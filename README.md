# GPay Replica Application

Welcome to the GPay Application project! This project is a comprehensive replica of the Google Pay (GPay) application, featuring a user-friendly frontend built with HTML 5.5 and CSS, and a robust backend implemented using Oracle SQL Developer and Node.js. The registration form is designed to closely mimic the Google Pay registration process, and the backend encompasses various database operations such as DDL, DML, and TCL, along with the sophisticated use of cursors, triggers, and PL/SQL.

## Overview

Google Pay, also known as GPay, revolutionizes digital transactions by enabling users to make contactless purchases with electronic devices such as phones and tablets. Merchant transactions are simplified through QR code scanning, and money transfers to friends or other users can be effortlessly completed using phone numbers via any UPI application. This application eliminates the need for physical currency, making transactions efficient and resourceful, contributing to a seamless day-to-day life in our technologically advancing world.

## Features

### Registration Form
Create an interactive registration form for users applying for Google Pay, mirroring the user-friendly and efficient Google Pay registration process.

### Database Operations
Utilize Oracle SQL Developer for DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), and TCL (Transaction Control Language) operations, ensuring seamless management of user data.

### Backend Logic
Implement robust backend logic using Node.js, incorporating advanced features such as cursors, triggers, and PL/SQL for optimal performance and reliability.

### Visual Studio Code Integration
Developed using Visual Studio Code (VSS) for code editing, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development process.

## Usage

### Setup Oracle SQL Developer:

1. Execute DDL scripts to create necessary tables for user information.
2. Use DML operations to manage data in the database.


## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- HTML 5.5
- CSS

### Backend:
- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Database:
- Oracle SQL Developer

### Editor:
- Visual Studio Code (VSS)

## Database Operations

Utilize Oracle SQL Developer for various database operations, including:

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Create tables and define their structure.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Insert, update, and delete data in the tables.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Manage transactions for data consistency.

## NoSQL Database Integration

Integrate MongoDB as a NoSQL database for enhanced data storage and retrieval capabilities. Leverage the flexibility and scalability of MongoDB in conjunction with Node.js and Express.js for seamless integration with the existing backend.
